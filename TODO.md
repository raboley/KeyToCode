# TODO before release

* Add a hotkey for playing the recording
* when hitting the stop recording button it should move focus back to the scripter window
* The play button should toggle between play and pause, and maybe we add a stop button as well?
* make a button that will make the playback loop endlessly
* package up the keyboard class and publish it
* package up the app and publish it
* Create a README.md for how to use the tool to generate keyboard scripts
* add a section for how to use the keyboard library.
