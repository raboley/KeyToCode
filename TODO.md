# TODO before release

* make it so you can edit the script in the text window.
* Make it so you can customize the hotkeys for stopping and starting recording
* Add a hotkey for playing the recording
* when hitting the stop recording button it should move focus back to the scripter window
* The play button should toggle between play and pause, and maybe we add a stop button as well?
* make a button that will make the playback loop endlessly
